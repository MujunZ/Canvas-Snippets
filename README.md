Canvas Snippets is a plugin for SublimeText 2 & 3 to make coding with HTML5 Canvas API a little easier.

### Installing
***
Download the latest version:  

* https://github.com/skadimoolam/Canvas-Snippets/releases

#### or

Install it via Package Control.  

* Install [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)        
* Find PackageControl in the Command Palette(`CTRL+SHIFT+P`)  
* Search for `Canvas Snippets` and Install it.


### Using
***
Using these snippets are as easy as typeing the first two letters of a Method and Entering `Tab`.

Examples:

* To revel the `stroke()` method, type `st` and Press `Tab`.
* To insert the `rotate()` method, type `ro` and Press `Tab`.

And So on.........

For when the Method/Property names are more than one word, type the second word's first two letters with the first two letters of the first word like in the examples below.

* To revel the `shadowColor` property, type `shco` and Press `Tab`.
* To insert the `beginPath()` method, type `bepa` and Press `Tab`.

And So on.........

**NOTE**: Remember everything you type before entering the `Tab` must be in Lower Case.


### Major Change since v1.1.0
***
Up until this release you would have to type `context` or `ctx` or whatever you have named the Canvas' Context and then the tabtrigger to insert a snippet but, from here on you don't have to enter the Context, it set to "ctx" as default and **cannot be changed**.

So, if you type `fi`  
previously it would just be `fill()`  
but now it will be `ctx.fill()`

I have also added a [CheatSheet.txt](https://github.com/skadimoolam/Canvas-Snippets/blob/master/CheatSheet.txt) which you can make use of when using these snippets.
